The book I have read many times and holds a special place in my heart is "To Live" by Yu Hua. This novel is set against the backdrop of China during the Cultural Revolution and its aftermath. 

It is a novel about a man named Xu Fugui who lives through many hardships in China’s turbulent history. He loses his father, mother, wife, son, daughter, daughter-in-law and grandson one by one, until he is left alone with an old ox named Fugui, but he never gives up on living. 

I have read this book many times because it is very touching and inspiring. It teaches me to value life and be optimistic and brave. The book has influenced me a lot and made me more empathetic and grateful.

What makes "To Live" truly remarkable is its ability to capture the essence of the human experience. It delves into the complexities of family, love, loss, and the indomitable resilience of the human spirit. Fugui's unwavering determination to find meaning amidst adversity resonates deeply with me.

With each reading, the book leaves an indelible mark on my soul. It makes me realize how life is fragile and how people are strong. It makes me grateful for the happy moments and the people I love in my life. Also, “To Live” teaches me about history and how politics affect people and society. It makes me feel for those who have suffered like the characters and makes me curious about their stories.

In essence, "To Live" is more than just a book to me; it is a great work of art that has changed how I see life.  Its nice story, important ideas, and memorable characters have made me excited, inspiring me to live with courage, enjoy the now, and believe in myself.
